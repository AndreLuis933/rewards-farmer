Automation for MS Rewards based on [https://youtu.be/4qdPcMNaioA](https://youtu.be/4qdPcMNaioA).

# Running Instructions

IMPORTANT: Use at your own risk. Microsoft may take action against your account for using automated scripts to gain rewards points. The YouTube video contains more details about the techniques implemented to avoid detection of this script.

Clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/User0332/rewards-farmer
```

A sample `nouns.txt` file is included in the project root and can be modified by the user to contain seed words for the LLM to complete 20 searches. The wordlist should be separated by newline.

```sh
cd rewards-farmer
# Edit the included nouns.txt file to add or replace words as needed
```

# Where search queries come from

The bot needs short strings to type into Bing. Two backends produce them, set with `QUERY_SOURCE`:

| `QUERY_SOURCE` | Needs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `llm` (default) | Ollama account + model | Current behaviour, unchanged |
| `trends` | nothing | Google Trends, Wikipedia and Bing autosuggest |

```sh
QUERY_SOURCE=trends python src/main.py          # bash
$env:QUERY_SOURCE="trends"; python src/main.py  # PowerShell
```

`trends` needs no account, no API key and no model download, so the Ollama setup below is optional if you use it. If every feed is unreachable it falls back to `nouns.txt` rather than failing the run.

You should also have an Ollama account created (for the LLM), the `ollama` tool installed, and you should have signed in to the Ollama CLI via the command line using `ollama signin`. This project will use a minimal amount of Ollama cloud usage using `gemma4:cloud`. If you wish to use a different model, please change the `model` parameter in the `get_ollama_response` function in `src/llm_utils.py`.

You must also provide an image for the script to upload to complete the visual search task. A helper script is included at `src/random_image_for_visual_search.py` that will download an image from Wikipedia named `visual_search.jpg` into the project root for you. You may also provide an image of your own, just ensure that the absolute path of the image is placed in the `VISUAL_SEARCH_IMAGE_PATH` constant at the top of `rewards_tasks.py`.

Activate the virtual environment & install dependencies (you may have to use `python -m poetry` instead of `poetry`).
You must have Python 3.12+ and Poetry installed.

If `iex (poetry env activate)` fails with *"Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Command' because it is null"*, `poetry install` did not create an environment. Run `python --version` first: an older Python leaves poetry with nothing to activate, and the message explaining that goes to stderr rather than into `iex`.

Windows (PowerShell)
```sh
poetry install
iex (poetry env activate)
```

*nix (Bash)
```sh
poetry install
eval $(poetry env activate)
```

You must also have a [webdriver for Microsoft Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webdriver/?tabs=c-sharp) installed. If you already have the Edge Browser installed, you probably have this component as well.

The profile directory in `src/constants.py` is set to `Default`. If this signs you in to a global profile that you do not want to use for automation, then you can create a new profile from within the webdriver instance manually and then change the `PROFILE_NAME` constant to `Profile 1` (or the equivalent number).

Run main.py (`python src/main.py`, it must be run from the root directory so the relative paths work out), wait for the page to launch, and then CTRL-C to quit the application immediately. Sign in to the created profile with your Microsoft account on both Bing and `rewards.bing.com`.

EU Users: you may have to accept a consent banner once on `rewards.bing.com` and on the Bing search page, `bing.com`. Once you consent, your choice will be saved for future runs using the same profile, so you will not need to interact with the banner during automated runs.

Close all webdriver browser instances. Run `main.py` again; the automation should start working.

# Running more than one account

Rewards is per Microsoft account and the browser profile holds the sign-in, so an account here is a profile directory. `REWARDS_ACCOUNTS` takes a comma separated list, and each name gets its own directory under `data-dir`:

```sh
REWARDS_ACCOUNTS=personal,spare python src/main.py
```

Each is signed in once by hand, the same way as the single profile, using its own directory:

```
msedge --user-data-dir="<repo>\data-dir\personal" --profile-directory=Default https://rewards.bing.com
```

They run one after another, and an account that fails is reported and skipped rather than ending the run, whether it fails to start or dies partway through. Leave `REWARDS_ACCOUNTS` unset and everything behaves exactly as before, using the single profile in `data-dir`.

# Docker

Runs the bot without installing Edge, a driver or Python on the host.

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm rewards-farmer
```

The container defaults to `QUERY_SOURCE=trends`, so it needs no Ollama account and no model. Set `QUERY_SOURCE=llm` and `OLLAMA_HOST` to a reachable address to use a model instead.

**Sign in first.** The profile starts logged out and the container has no physical display, so sign-in happens inside the container over a virtual display exposed through noVNC — a web page you open in your normal browser. This works on Windows, macOS and Linux hosts, because the profile is created and read back by the same Linux container, so the Chromium cookie key is consistent between them.

The profile lives in a **named Docker volume** (`rewards-data`), not a bind mount, so it is isolated from any `data-dir` used by a native (non-Docker) run on the host. Docker manages it under `/var/lib/docker/volumes`; it survives container rebuilds and is shared between login and run mode.

### One-time sign-in (single account)

Build the image, then run it in login mode, mapping port 6080:

```sh
docker compose run --rm -p 6080:6080 rewards-farmer login
```

Open <http://localhost:6080/vnc.html> in a browser on the host. You will see an Edge window pointing at `rewards.bing.com`. Sign in with your Microsoft account there, on both Bing and `rewards.bing.com`.

EU users: accept the consent banner once on `rewards.bing.com` and on `bing.com`. The choice is saved to the profile and applies to every later run.

When signed in, **close Edge normally** (close the tab/window, or use Edge's menu → Quit). Closing Edge cleanly lets the container exit on its own and leaves the profile ready. If you kill the container with `Ctrl+C` or `docker kill`, Edge leaves a `SingletonLock` behind — the entrypoint removes stale locks automatically on the next run, but it is still cleaner to close Edge first.

### One-time sign-in (multiple accounts)

`REWARDS_ACCOUNTS` takes a comma separated list; each name gets its own directory under `data-dir`. Sign in **one account at a time** — pass only the first name in the list for each login run:

```sh
REWARDS_ACCOUNTS=personal docker compose run --rm -p 6080:6080 rewards-farmer login
# close Edge when done, then:
REWARDS_ACCOUNTS=spare docker compose run --rm -p 6080:6080 rewards-farmer login
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:REWARDS_ACCOUNTS="personal"; docker compose run --rm -p 6080:6080 rewards-farmer login
```

### Daily run

After the one-time sign-in, run the bot headless — no port mapping, no display:

```sh
docker compose run --rm rewards-farmer
```

With multiple accounts:

```sh
REWARDS_ACCOUNTS=personal,spare docker compose run --rm rewards-farmer
```

`REWARDS_HEADLESS=1` is set in the image. It also works on the host if you want a run with no visible window; the pointer code needs an explicit window size in that mode, which `main.py` sets.

**Provide the visual search image on the host too.** `visual_search.jpg` is not in the repository and is not built into the image, so create it once in the project root and the compose file mounts it in:

```sh
python src/random_image_for_visual_search.py
```

Without it every other task still runs; only the visual search one fails.

### On a VPS

The same flow works on a Linux VPS. For the sign-in step, tunnel port 6080 to your local machine instead of opening it publicly:

```sh
ssh -L 6080:localhost:6080 user@your-vps
# then on the VPS:
docker compose run --rm -p 6080:6080 rewards-farmer login
```

Open <http://localhost:6080/vnc.html> on your local browser as usual.

# Logging

The script logs to the console. Two optional environment variables change that:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REWARDS_FARMER_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Set to `DEBUG` to also attach the full stack trace to every `[FAIL]` line. |
| `REWARDS_FARMER_LOG_FILE` | unset | Path to also write the log to, useful for unattended runs. |

Windows (PowerShell)
```sh
$env:REWARDS_FARMER_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"; $env:REWARDS_FARMER_LOG_FILE="run.log"; python src/main.py
```

*nix (Bash)
```sh
REWARDS_FARMER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG REWARDS_FARMER_LOG_FILE=run.log python src/main.py
```

If you are opening an issue about a crash, running with `REWARDS_FARMER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and attaching the log is the most useful thing you can include.

Please open up a GitHub issue if you run into any difficulties.
